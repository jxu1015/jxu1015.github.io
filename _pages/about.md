> I’m currently an assistant professor in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics (HOBI) at the University of Florida College of Medicine. I am hired at HOBI as part of UF’s AI Initiative. Prior to that, I completed my postdoctoral research with [Dr. Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Jyotishman Pathak](https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-jyp2001) in the Department of Population Health Sciences at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I received my BSc degree in biomedical engineering, MSc and PhD degrees in circuits and systems from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), Xi’an, China, in 2012, 2015 and 2018, respectively. Besides, I studied at [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/) and [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) as a joint doctoral student in computer science department from 2016 to 2018.

Currently, my primary research interest is data analytic, privacy preserving technology and their applications in health informatics. One key aspect I have been working on is evaluating the clinical similarity between pairwise patients according to their historical EHR in federated environment. Besides this, I also work on the privacy preserving technology like differential privacy in order to further protect patient's information. Another major research topic that I am working on is to identify the potential sub-phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease and use machine learning models to predict the future incidence of AD using administrative EHR in individuals.
