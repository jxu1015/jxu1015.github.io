I received the B.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering, the M.Sc. degree and the PhD degree in circuits and
systems from Xidian University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2012, 2015 and 2018, respectively. 
Besides, I studied at University of Texas at Arlington and University of Pittsburgh as a joint doctoral student from 2016 to 2018. Now, I am doing my research in Weil Cornell Medicine College, Cornell University as a postdoctor.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence.
