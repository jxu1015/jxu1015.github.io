I received the B.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering, the M.Sc. degree and the PhD degree in circuits and
systems from Xidian University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2012, 2015 and 2018, respectively. 
Besides, I studied at University of Texas at Arlington and University of Pittsburgh as a joint doctoral student from 2016 to 2018. Now, I am doing my research as a postdoctor in [Weill Cornell Medicine College](https://weill.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).

Currently, my primary research interest is data analytic, privacy preserving technology and their applications in health informatics. One key aspect I have been working on is evaluating the clinical similarity between pairwise patients according to their historical EHR in federated environment. Besides this, I also work on the privacy preserving technology like differential privacy in order to further protect patient's information. Another major research topic that I am working on is to identify the potential sub-phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease and use machine learning models to predict the future incidence of AD using administrative EHR in individuals.
