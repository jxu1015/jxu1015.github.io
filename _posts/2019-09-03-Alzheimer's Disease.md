Why EHRs are essential for treating Alzheimer's patients?

## Header two

### Ongoing care

What makes Alzheimer's so difficult to diagnosis is how quickly the disease can change. Once a patient turns 65, his or her chances of developing the condition doubles every five years. Detailed health histories become even more important in catching any red flags as early as possible in old age. Following a positive diagnosis, an EHR continues to be an essential tool. Physicians and families can chart and monitor changes in memory, word use, independence and other changing factors closely tied to the disorder. 

Aside from cognitive decline, patients living with Alzheimer's face other health problems. Conditions like obesity, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and others are not only early warning signs for Alzheimerâ€‹'s, but as the disease progresses, these sorts of problems become worse. Tracking these changes and documenting issues is helpful in building a targeted treatment plan.

Patient-facing EHR portals can help families because physicians can more clearly outline a treatment plan, and improved communication streams make it much easier to share new updates or information. One major consideration for keeping Alzheimer's patients healthy and safe is finding ways to promote medication adherence. Missing a prescription or taking the wrong dosage can lead to very serious complications, but forgetfulness elevates this risk.

Moving forward, there is hope that the information provided by EHRs can help improve Alzheimer's care across the board. Researchers are already leveraging patient data to identify evidence-based practices and uncover new options for combating the disease. As the population ages, EHR systems will only become more important. From start to finish, these platforms give physicians a better chance to diagnose and treat patients, as well as learn from their experiences.
