## What is Ology (学问)?

* [Pathobiology](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/academic-departments/pathobiology) is an interdisciplinary field devoted to basic research into the mechanisms of disease. 
The techniques of molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry are used to characterize structural, functional, and chemical abnormalities occurring at the intercelluar and subcellular levels.
病理生物学是一个跨学科领域，致力于疾病机制的基础研究。分子生物学、细胞生物学和生物化学技术用于描述发生在细胞间和亚细胞水平的结构、功能和化学异常。

* [Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology) is the study of the body's reaction to drugs.
药理学是研究人体对药物的反应。

* [Epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events (including disease), and the application of this study to the control of diseases and other health problems.
流行病学是研究与健康有关的状态或事件(包括疾病)的分布和决定因素，并将这项研究应用于疾病和其他健康问题的控制。

* [Pharmacoepidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacoepidemiology) is the study of the utilization and effects of drugs in large numbers of people; it provides an estimate of the probability of beneficial effects of a drug in a population and the probability of adverse effects. It can be called a bridge science spanning both clinical pharmacology and epidemiology.
药物流行病学是研究药物在大量人群中的使用和作用的学科;它提供了一种药物在人群中产生有益影响的概率和产生不良影响的概率的估计。它可以被称为跨越临床药理学和流行病学的桥梁科学。

## What is Omics (组学)?

* [Multiomics](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Multiomics.aspx)(多组学) is a new approach where the data sets of different omic groups are combined during analysis. The different omic strategies employed during multiomics are genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, and microbiome. 
多组学是一种将不同组群的数据集在分析过程中进行组合的新方法。在多组学中采用的不同的基因组策略包括基因组、蛋白质组、转录组、表观基因组和微生物组。

* Genomics (基因组学)
{: .small}

:   Genomics is a field which involves identification of genes and genetic variants associated with a disease or in response to certain drugs and medication. In this approach, GWAS or Genome Wide Association Studies are used to identify genetic variants in an entire genome which are associated with a disease.
基因组学是一个涉及到识别与疾病相关的基因和遗传变异或对某些药物的反应的领域。在这种方法中，GWAS或全基因组关联研究被用来识别整个基因组中与疾病相关的遗传变异。
{: .small}

:   Genotyping is performed for thousands of people for almost a million markers to identify significant differences in genetic markers between healthy and diseased individuals. Apart from GWAS, genotype arrays, next generation sequencing and exome sequencing are also applied in this approach.
对成千上万人进行了基因分型，使用了近100万个标记，以确定健康和患病个体之间的遗传标记的显著差异。除了GWAS外，该方法还应用了基因型阵列、下一代测序和外显子组测序。
{: .small}

* Epigenomics (表观基因组学)
{: .small}

:     Epigenomics refers to identifying modifications of DNA or DNA-associated proteins. These include DNA acetylation/deacetylation and methylation. Cell fate and functions can be modified by modifications in DNA and histones, apart from genetic changes. These changes can be based on the environment and are passed onto progeny. 
表观基因组学指的是识别DNA或DNA相关蛋白的修饰。这些包括DNA乙酰化/去乙酰化和甲基化。除了基因改变外，细胞的命运和功能也可以通过DNA和组蛋白的改变来改变。这些变化可以基于环境，并传递给后代。
{: .small}

:   Epigenetic changes in genome can also act as markers for metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, and physiological disorders. These changes can be cell-and tissue-specific. Thus, it is critical to identify the epigenetic changes during native and diseased states. Next generation sequencing is also used to assess DNA modifications.
基因组的表观遗传变化也可以作为代谢综合征、心血管疾病和生理疾病的标记。这些变化可能是细胞和组织特异性的。因此，确定自然状态和疾病状态下的表观遗传变化是至关重要的。下一代测序也被用来评估DNA修饰。
{: .small}

* Transcriptomics (转录组)
{: .small}

:   This approach is used to identify the qualitative and quantitative RNA levels in the whole genome. This includes which transcripts are present and the levels of their expression. Although only 2% of the DNA is translated in to protein, almost 80% of the genome is transcribed. This includes the coding RNA, short RNA, including microRNA, piwi RNA, small nuclear RNA.
该方法用于识别整个基因组中RNA的定性和定量水平。这包括存在哪些转录本以及它们的表达水平。虽然只有2%的DNA被翻译成蛋白质，但几乎80%的基因组被转录。这包括编码RNA，短RNA，包括microRNA, piwi RNA，小核RNA。
{: .small}

:   Apart from acting as an intermediate between DNA and protein, RNA also has structural and regulatory functions during native and altered states. They have been shown to have a role in myocardial infarction, adipose differentiation, diabetes, endocrine regulation, neuron development, and others.
除了作为DNA和蛋白质之间的中介，RNA在自然状态和改变状态下还具有结构和调节功能。它们已被证明在心肌梗死、脂肪分化、糖尿病、内分泌调节、神经元发育等方面发挥作用。
{: .small}

:   Thus, it is crucial to understand which transcripts are expressed at a time. Apart from next generation sequencing, probe-based assays, and RNA-seq are also used in this approach.
因此，理解哪些转录在同一时间被表达是至关重要的。除了下一代测序外，基于探针的测定和RNA-seq也被用于这种方法。
{: .small}

* Proteomics (蛋白质组学)
{: .small}

:   This field is involved in identifying protein levels, modifications, and interactions at the level of genome.  Protein-protein interactions can be studied through phage display, classical yeast two hybrid, affinity purification, and ChiP-Seq.
这一领域涉及到识别蛋白质水平、修饰和基因组水平上的相互作用。蛋白质之间的相互作用可以通过噬菌体展示、经典酵母双杂交、亲和纯化和ChiP-Seq来研究。
{: .small}

:   The majority of proteins are regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, nitrosylation, and glycosylation.
大多数蛋白质通过翻译后修饰进行调控，如磷酸化、乙酰化、泛素化、亚硝基化和糖基化。
{: .small}

:   These modifications are involved in maintaining cellular structure and function. Mass spectroscopy based techniques are being used to analyse the global proteomic changes and quantifying the post translational modifications.
这些改变涉及到维持细胞结构和功能。基于质谱的技术被用来分析全球蛋白质组的变化和量化翻译后的修饰。
{: .small

* Metabolomics (代谢组学)
{: .small}

:   Metabolome comprises all the metabolites present in a cell, tissue, or organism, including small molecules, carbohydrates, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, and catabolic products. It represents the final product of gene transcription, and consists of both signaling and structural molecules. The size of metabolome is much smaller than the size of proteome, and thus it is easier to investigate.
代谢组包括细胞、组织或有机体中存在的所有代谢物，包括小分子、碳水化合物、多肽、脂类、核苷和分解代谢产物。它是基因转录的最终产物，由信号分子和结构分子组成。代谢组的大小远小于蛋白质组的大小，因此更易于研究。
{: .small}


* Microbiomics
:   Microbiomics consists of all the microorganisms of a community. Microbes have been found in human skin, mucosal surfaces, and gut.  The microbiome present in humans is very complex, where the gut consists of 100 trillion bacteria.
微生物学由一个群落的所有微生物组成。微生物已经在人类皮肤、粘膜表面和肠道中被发现。人体的微生物群落非常复杂，肠道由100万亿个细菌组成。
{: .small}


:   Microbiota has been found to be involved in diabetes, obesity, cancer, colitis, heart disease, and autism. Thus, characterization of the microbiome or an organism has gained a lot of attention. The microbiome is analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes or metagenomics quantification.
微生物群已被发现与糖尿病、肥胖、癌症、结肠炎、心脏病和自闭症有关。因此，微生物或有机体的特性得到了广泛的关注。通过测序16S rRNA基因或宏基因组定量分析微生物组。
{: .small}


* Multiomics strategy
{: .small}


:   With the progress in all the different omics fields, it is being increasingly recognized that the answer to a research question cannot be answered by one form of omics. The microbiome influences the gene and protein expression which in turn influence the metabolome, and all these processes crosstalk and regulate each other.
随着所有不同的组学领域的进步，越来越多的人认识到，一个研究问题的答案不能用一种组学来回答。微生物组影响基因和蛋白质的表达，而基因和蛋白质的表达反过来又影响代谢组，所有这些过程相互干扰和调节。
{: .small}


:   Studying theese processes in their entirety is critical to find strategies to treat diseases. This is where the multiomics field is coming in. This field encompasses all the omics fields and trues to understand the native and altered state of an organism by the analysis of the data from different omics experiments.
全面研究这些过程对于找到治疗疾病的策略至关重要。这就是多元经济学领域的用武之地。这个领域包含了所有的组学领域，通过分析来自不同组学实验的数据来理解生物体的自然状态和改变状态。
