## Potential drug-drug interactions in older adults with dementia

Bogetti-Salazar, Michele, et al. "Severe potential drug-drug interactions in older adults with dementia and associated factors." Clinics 71.1 (2016): 17-21. [[Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763155/pdf/cln-71-01-017.pdf)]

The main severe potential drug-drug interactions were caused by the combinations [citalopram](https://www.drugs.com/citalopram.html)/[antiplatelet](https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/antiplatelet-agents.html) (11.6%), [clopidogrel](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/clopidogrel.html)/[omeprazole](https://www.drugs.com/omeprazole.html) (6.1%), and clopidogrel/ aspirin (5.5%). Antidepressants, antiplatelets, anti-psychotics and omeprazole were the drugs most commonly involved in severe potential drug-drug interactions. Despite their frequent use, anti-dementia drugs were not involved in these interactions. The number and type of medications taken, dementia severity and depression in patients in addition to caregiver burden should be considered to avoid possible drug interactions in this population.
